# Link Converter Backend Application

This application converts submitted urls to deeplink or web link.

We can run the application in two steps.

 1. Step - We need to build the application
 > mvn clean install

 2. Step - We can launch the application using docker-compose
 > docker-compose up -d

I added posman collections under docs so that the application can be tested. 
You can also test using localhost: 8090 / swagger-ui.html.

Used technologies
  - Spring Boot
  - Java 8
  - Elasticsearch
  - Docker
  - Swagger UI
  - JMockit
